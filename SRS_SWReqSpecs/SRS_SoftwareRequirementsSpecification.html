    <h1><span class="id">1</span>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Uvents is a mobile application that brings the community together by allowing personal users to create events (which can be set as a group event or a date event), commercial users to list their promotions (which can be seen by the personal users and
        added to their events), and admin users to manage event policies. </p>
    <div class="indent">
        <h2><span class="id">1.1</span>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of Uvents is to provide personal users a two-way experience by allowing them choose to participate in events created by other users and publish their own events. Additionally, users will have access to a list of promotions offered by
            local businesses and can add those promotions to their events. Uvents will receive revenue by having commercial users pay to have their promotions listed in the application. Finally, Uvents provides a convenient way for people to easily arrange
            local events that bring revenue to the local economy and provide recreation for the local residents. </p>
        <h2><span class="id">1.2</span>Scope</h2>
        <p>Uvents is an application for people to post activities/dates and for people to find and join those activities/dates. Businesses can also pay for a select spot on the application for consumer users to view their activities. </p>
        <p class="list-title">The application will allow consumer users to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>View activities posted </li>
            <li>Join an event </li>
            <li>Chat with those in the activity to establish details </li>
            <li>Post a group event </li>
            <li>Post a one-on-one date with the opposite sex </li>
            <li>Post a group date for 4-6 couples </li>
            <li>Join a date </li>
            <li>The consumer user that posted the event/date would have control of said event </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="list-title">The application will allow commercial users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Post activities that feature their businesses</li>
            <li>Pay for select spots where their activity will appear </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Uvents will help people meet new friends while experiencing an event together. Uvents will also allow those consumer users to post a date or sign up for a date. Businesses will have the ability to promote their events for a price. This feature
            will create revenue. </p>
        <h2><span class="id">1.3</span>Product Overview</h2>
        <p>Uvents is a social app that will provide opportunities to meet new people while doing fun activities. Events will be able to be created by businesses and individuals in order to facilitate these opportunities. Businesses can create events which
            can be joined. Funding for the app will come in the form of businesses bidding for priority listings for their sponsored activities. The application will provide a simple experience so that focus can be placed on the activities and social
            connections of participants themselves. </p>

            <div class="indent">
                <h4 class="big"><span class="id">1.3.3.1</span> Consumer </h4>
                <p>For consumers, the application will be a way to be notified of events in their relative location. The application will be a platform where the consumer receives notifications of the [unfinished!] </p>
                <h4 class="big"><span class="id">1.3.3.2</span>Commercial</h4>
                <p>From the perspective of the commercial user this app will be a platform where they can advertise events, activities, and products that the businesses offer. This will help them to attract customers and increase visibility with the public.
                    As an example, Fat Cats could purchase an event listing slot in the app and advertise their movie theater, then consumers who use the app to find ideas for group events and dates would see that event listing. </p>
                <h4 class="big"><span class="id">1.3.3.3</span>Admin</h4>
                <p>For the administrator, the app will be a medium for businesses to attract users with promotions and events. An admin has certain duties and obligations which must be fulfilled. To fulfill these duties, the app should be easy to
                    update and manipulate. The Admin seeks to make the app profitable by attracting and retaining users and businesses. To retain users, it is crucial that the administrator can fulfil the needs of both users and businesses. </p>
